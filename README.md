## Summary
Board Games are slowly becoming an integral part of the life. Using a collection of different features about the most popular games, we aim to extract the recipe for the most popular board game. We use the Board Game Geek database as the main data bank and analyse different hypotheses and conditions to recommend the best game.

## Data Selection & Collection
The goal of the analysis is to find the best parameters to make a game. In this sense, BoardGameGeek is a large repository of games and their metrics. BoardGameGeek is a community platform for board game enthusiasts to discuss and explore new board games, interact about their progress and rate their favorites. The database also has numerous details about each game. The categories, themes, mechanics, popularity metrics among others can help us gain deep insights into the community of board game players.

We found many people had tried to collect different aspects and details about board games. But the BGG database seemed to be the most complete. We found a very recent snapshot of this data on Kaggle and chose to use that for our analysis. The data was scraped and collected by a user on Kaggle. More details about the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/threnjen/board-games-database-from-boardgamegeek?select=bgg_data_documentation.txt).
